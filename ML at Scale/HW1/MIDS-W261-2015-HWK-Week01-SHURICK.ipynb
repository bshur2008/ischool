For example, we may need to use cheap storage and Hadoop in order to store all of our operational and customer usage data, because we don't always know what features we might need to utilize for recommendations based on observational data. We might need to build complicated data processing code to cleans and connect all of the types of data we record. Lastly, we might need to build infrastructure that can support realtime analysis at high-speed. "

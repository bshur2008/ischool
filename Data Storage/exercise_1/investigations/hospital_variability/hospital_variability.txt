Aspirin at Arrival has the highest variability when measured as standard
deviation of percentile ranking across hospitals. Standard deviation is the
metric of choice to show dispersion when the units are consistent among
metrics, which is the case because I continue to use percentile ranking for
each procedure among hospitals.

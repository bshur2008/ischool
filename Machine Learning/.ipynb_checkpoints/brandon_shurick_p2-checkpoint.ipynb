    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

First, to train Word2Vec it is better not to remove stop words because the algorithm relies on the broader context of the sentence in order to produce high-quality word vectors. For this reason, we will make stop word removal optional in the functions below. It also might be better not to remove numbers, but we leave that as an exercise for the reader."
